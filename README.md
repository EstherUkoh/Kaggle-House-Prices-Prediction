# Kaggle-House-Prices-Prediction
# Project Overview
In this project, I applied data science and machine learning skills to develop a predictive model for house prices. This project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. A real-world dataset(House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques from Kaggle) was used to build a model that can accurately predict house prices based on various house related features.
